# LQR-and-LQG-controllers-for-controlling-the-inverted-pendulum
In this study, an inverted pendulum is modeled for pendulum stability. Full state feedback, Linear Quadratic Regulator controller, and Linear Quadratic Gaussian control methods are used to control the modeled system, and the outcomes are studied. To achieve this purpose, it must be identified  which control approach performs best in terms of pendulum angle and position. Because it constantly progresses toward an uncontrolled state, the inverted pendulum poses a difficult control problem. A simulation analysis conducted in MATLAB and Matlab Simulink shown that both LQR and LQG are capable of successfully controlling this system.
